        Set the image mode (IMODE) for the image.
        <p>
        "This field shall indicate how the
        Image Pixels are stored in the NITF file. Valid
        values are B, P, R, and S. The interpretation of
        IMODE is dependent on whether the image is JPEG
        compressed (IC = C3, C5, I1, M3, or M5), VQ
        compressed (IC = C4, or M4), or uncompressed (IC
        = NC or NM).
        a. Uncompressed. The value S indicates band
        sequential, where all blocks for the first band
        are followed by all blocks for the second band,
        and so on: [(block1, band1), (block2, band1), ...
        (blockM, band1)], [(block1, band2), (block2,
        band 2), ... (blockM, band2)] ... [(block1,
        bandN), (block2, bandN), ... (blockM,
        bandN)]. Note that, in each block, the pixels of
        the first line appears first, followed by the
        pixels of the second line, and so on.
        The value B indicates band interleaved by
        block. This implies that within each block, the
        bands follow one another: [(block1, band1),
        (block1, band2), ...(block1, bandN)], [(block2,
        band1), (block2, band2), ... (block2, bandN)],
        ... [(blockM, band1), (blockM, band2), ...
        (blockM, bandN)]. Note that, in each block,
        the pixels of the first line appears first and the
        pixels of the last line appears last.
        The value P indicates band interleaved by pixel
        within each block: such as, for each block, one
        after the other, the full pixel vector (all band
        values) appears for every pixel in the block, one
        pixel after another, the block column index
        varying faster than the block row index.
        The value R indicates band interleaved by row.
        The ordering mechanism for this case stores the
        pixel values of each band in row sequential
        order. Within each block, all pixel values of the
        first row of the first band are followed by pixel
        values of the first row of the second band
        continuing until all values of the first row are
        stored The remaining rows are stored in a similar
        fashion until the last row of values has been
        stored. Each block shall be zero-filled to the
        next octet boundary when necessary.
        If the value of the NBANDS field is 1, the cases
        B and S coincide. In this case, this field shall
        contain B. If the Number of Blocks is 1 (the
        NBPR field and the NBPC field contain 1), this
        field shall contain B for non-interleaved by
        pixel, and P for interleaved by pixel. The value
        S is only valid for images with multiple blocks
        and multiple bands.
        b. JPEG-compressed. The presence of B, P, or
        S implies specific ordering of data within the
        JPEG image data representation. For this case
        the interpretation of the various values of the
        IMODE field is specified in MIL-STD-188-
        198A. When IC contains C8, M8, or I1,
        IMODE contains B.
        c. Vector Quantization compressed. VQ
        compressed images are normally either RGB
        with a color look-up table or monochromatic. In
        either case, the image is single band, and the
        IMODE field defaults to B.
        d. Bi-Level Compressed. When the value of the
        IC field is C1 or M1, the value of the IMODE
        field is B."
